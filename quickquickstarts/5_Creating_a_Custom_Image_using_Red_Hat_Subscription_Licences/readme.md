# Create a custom RHEL image using a RHEL ISO where you can use eligible Red Hat licences

> NOTICE! We are deprecating the ability to create images from RHEL ISO sources, however we will shortly be releasing an alternative by end of May.

```bash
Timelines:
* 31st March - Image Templates with RHEL ISO sources will now longer be accepted by the resource provider.
* 30th April - Image Templates that contain RHEL ISO sources will not be processed any more.
```
