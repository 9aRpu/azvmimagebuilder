To use this, see this [blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-private-preview-of-azure-vm-image-builder/) and sign up!

This repo contains mutliple examples and test templates for Azure VM Image Builder.


1. [Quick QuickStarts Examples](/quickquickstarts/readme.md).
You can run these immediately using the Azure CloudShell from the Portal, and see multiple scenarios that the VM Image Builder supports. 


2. [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Image Builder Examples](/armTemplates/README.md). 
The beauty of these examples, they are heavily parameterized, so you just need to drop in your own details, then begin image building, or integrate them to existing pipelines.
